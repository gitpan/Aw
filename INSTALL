Requirements
============

The Aw package should work on any platform that can host both ActiveWorks
and Perl.  The ActiveWorks C CADK (Commercial Adapter Development Kit)
must also have been installed (see "BUILDING") and a C compiler must be
available.

The package has been verified to work with ActiveWorks 3.0 and 4.0 and the
following OSs and versions of Perl:


Solaris 2.6 and
  Perl 5.004_04
  Perl 5.005_03
  Perl 5.6.1
  Perl 5.8.0

Solaris 8.0 and
  Perl 5.004_04
  Perl 5.8.0



Building
========

Assuming GNU tar:

  %  tar zxvf Aw-XY.tar.gz
  %  cd Aw-XY
  %  perl Makefile.PL
  %  make
  %  make install

The Makefile.PL may or may not detect the library directories where you have 
the ActiveWorks libraries installed.  If "perl Makefile.PL" gives warnings of
the form:

  Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lawalog30

you will need to edit c/Makefile.PL, xs/Makefile.PL and xs/Aw/Makefile.PL
to set the 'INC" and "LIBS' variables to contain the right path.
"/opt/active40/" is the assumed ActiveWorks installation path.



CADK and libcustcadk31
----------------------

If you see one (or probably two) warnings after running 'perl Makefile.PL"
like:

  Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lcustcadk31

it means that you have not built libcustcadk31 OR have not installed
the dependent sources for the "Commercial Adapter Development Kit".

To check installation, check for the presence of the directory:

  /opt/active40/samples/adapter_devkit/c_lib

or check in /var/opt/activesw/install40/pkginst.log, for the corresponding
strings:

  CADK-UNIX-Any: pkga0000 pkga0107
  CADK-UNIX-Any: "ActiveWorks Adapter Development Kit (Source) for Unix"

If you find either of these your installation should be ok and you need
only compile the library.  To do so (in a bash shell):

  % cd /opt/active40/samples/adapter_devkit/c_lib
  % export CLASSPATH=/opt/active40/classes
  % make -f Makefile.unix

If not installed, insert your ActiveWorks CD and install the
"ActiveWorks Commercial Adapter Development Kit on Multi-Platform"
with _both_ installation keys, you should see a message like:

  Item Name                                      Install Size
  ---- ----                                      ------- ----
  1)   Language Adapters                         Yes     6140 Kb
            Commercial Adapter Dev Kit

You may repeat the installation and add only the extra packages
that you wish without removing or harming your existing installation.

If you would rather not rerun the installation script again, you
can install the package manually by inserting the CD and:

  % cd /opt/active40 
  % tar zxvf /cdrom/activesw/unix/common/pkga107.taz

then, proceed to build the library as shown above and repeat the
'perl Makefile.PL' from the Aw directory.



Running
=======

If when running a test script you find an error like:

Can't load '/opt/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/sun4-solaris/auto/Aw/Aw.so' for module Aw: ld.so.1: perl: fatal: libawalog31.so: open failed: No such file or directory at /opt/lib/perl5/5.00503/sun4-solaris/DynaLoader.pm line 169.

then you will need to set your library path:

% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/active40/lib

(or wherever you have the libraries installed) and rerun the script.



Testing
=======

"make test" has not been implemented .  In the bin/ directory,
"time_adapter.pl" and "time_test.pl" are Perl rewrites of the provided AW
time adapters ("time_adapter.c", "TimeAdapter.java", "time_test.c" and
"TimeTest.java").

In one window or two:

  % ./time_adapter.pl 
  % ./time_test.pl
  

The best test of your system will be the EventOfDoom script (eod.pl) which
tries to create an event with one of each data type and deeply nested.  See
the bin/index.html for a complete list of provided test and demo scripts.
