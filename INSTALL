Building
========

Assuming GNU tar:

  %  tar zxvf Aw-XY.tar.gz
  %  cd Aw-XY
  %  perl Makefile.PL
  %  make
  %  make install  # if you have admin privileges (untested)

The Makefile.PL may or may not detect the library directories where you have 
the ActiveWorks libraries installed.  If "perl Makefile.PL" gives warnings of
the form:

  Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lawalog30

you will need to edit the "Makefile" (not "Makefile.PL") so that lib variables
contain "EXTRALIBS" and "LDLOADLIBS" appear as follows:

  EXTRALIBS = -lcustcadk30 -lawalog30 -lawl30 -lawc30 -lsocket -lnsl
  LDLOADLIBS = -lcustcadk30 -lawalog30 -lawl30 -lawc30 -lsocket -lnsl

The Makefile.PL is set for the 4.0 libraries by default.

If when running a test script you find an error like:

Can't load '/opt/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/sun4-solaris/auto/Aw/Aw.so' for module Aw: ld.so.1: perl: fatal: libawalog31.so: open failed: No such file or directory at /opt/lib/perl5/5.00503/sun4-solaris/DynaLoader.pm line 169.

then you will need to set your library path:

% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/active40/lib

(or wherever you have the libraries installed) and rerun the script.


Testing
=======

"make test" is not yet functional.  "time_adapter.pl" and "time_test.pl"
are Perl rewrites of the provided AW time adapters ("time_adapter.c",
"TimeAdapter.java", "time_test.c" and "TimeTest.java").

In one window or two:

  % ./time_adapter.pl 
  % ./time_test.pl
  

The best test of your system will be the EventOfDoom script (eod.pl) which
tries to create an event with one of each data type and deeply nested.  See
the bin/index.html for a complete list of provided test and demo scripts.
