# This adapter was originally created to play against

# this is a hack to allow the adapter to play against
# the "tictactoe" client script in addition to Apache.
# The "tictactoe" scripts were originally intended to
# play against one another.  They maintain their own
# boards and just send one another their latest move.
#
# This hack is easier than updating the clients to
# transmit their entire game board.  Which is required
# with apache since the apache child process can not
# guarantee persistance.
#
# We assume that the adapter interacts with only one
# client script at a time, so we just maintain a single

=head1 NAME

ttt_adapter.pl - A TicTacToe Adapter for ActiveWorks Brokers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

./ttt_adapter.pl MyBroker@MyHost:1234

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The TicTacToe adapter is based loosely on the Java applet by
Arthur van Hoff.  The adapter will play against the mod_perl
client found in bin/apache/site_perl/Apache/Toe.pm.  The adapter
can also play against the ttt_client.pl client script.
